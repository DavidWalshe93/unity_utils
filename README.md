### init

`Ã¬nit` is used to bootstrap a new Unity project to create the following structure

```
UnityProject/
    Assets/
        Audio/
        Docs/
        Scripts/
        Sprites/
        Scenes/
            Game.unity
    README.md
```

The above file structure is a typical starting point for most new project. To keep projects
structures similar between projects, the `init` command sets up a repeatable structure. This is 
handy for beginners or those working on various small projects starting out with Unity.
